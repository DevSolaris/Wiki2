# Installation

1. Put the **DeluxeChat jar** file you downloaded in your **plugins** folder. If you want to use it with BungeeCord, you'll have to put it in your BungeeCord's **plugins** folder too.
2. Download [**PlaceholderAPI**](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) plugin and put it in your plugins folder \(not on BungeeCord\).
3. Restart the servers.
4. Modify the **config.yml** and the **messages.yml** files that were generated to fit your server's layout \(Files path: `/plugins/DeluxeChat/`\).
5. Reload **DeluxeChat** `/dchat reload` \(Some options require a restart to apply the changes\).
6. Give your players the permission for their chat format `chatformat.<format-name>`. \(Note: Players need the `chatformat.default` to gain access to the default format. Also, operators do not get the **chatformat** permissions by default.\)
7. Check the [Commands & Permissions](commands-and-permissions.md) page, to give players access to the commands you want them to use.
8. And you're done! Give us a review about the plugin [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/deluxechat.1277/).
