## Creating JSON message

**JSON** message is the kind of messages that have hovering tooltips and clicking actions, you can simply create them from [minecraftjson.com](http://minecraftjson.com/) (or any **JSON** creation website).\
Follow the steps below to create your **JSON** message and use it in **DeluxeCommands**:

1. Create the **JSON** message using the website you like.
2. Copy the text after `@p` from the **Command:** box. e.g.\
   \
   `/tellraw @p ["",{"text":"This is a JSON text","color":"blue","clickEvent":{"action":"suggest_command","value":"/command"},"hoverEvent":{"action":"show_text","value":{"text":"","extra":[{"text":"Hey there!","color":"aqua"}]}}}]`\
   \
   Copy this part only:\
   `["",{"text":"This is a JSON text","color":"blue","clickEvent":{"action":"suggest_command","value":"/command"},"hoverEvent":{"action":"show_text","value":{"text":"","extra":[{"text":"Hey there!","color":"aqua"}]}}}]`\

3. Now paste it in your command in **DeluxeCommands** config file like this:\
   `- '["",{"text":"This is a JSON text","color":"blue","clickEvent":{"action":"suggest_command","value":"/command"},"hoverEvent":{"action":"show_text","value":{"text":"","extra":[{"text":"Hey there!","color":"aqua"}]}}}]'`\

4. Reload **DeluxeCommands** `/DeluxeCommands reload`.
