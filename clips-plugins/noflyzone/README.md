# NoFlyZone

## Description

**NoFlyZone** is a plugin that prevents players from flying in specific WorldGuard regions if they do not have permission.

## Instalation

All you need to do is add the region name to the NoFlyZone config list either by command or by editing the config manually and using /nfz reload. Anyone without the permission noflyzone.bypass will be stopped from flying as soon as they enter the region.

You NEED WorldGuard 6.x + WorldEdit for this plugin to work!
