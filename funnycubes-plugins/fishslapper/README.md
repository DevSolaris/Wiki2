# Fish Slapper

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/logo (1).png>)

FishSlapper allows any player with the correct permission to use raw fish as an tool to slap people around the server in a chaotic fashion. It's quite a simple concept, those with the permission allowing them have the permission to slap can slap anyone with the permission that allows them to be slapped. Once contact has been made between the fish and the player they are then sent flying away! (Pufferfish will allow for maximum slapping)

{% hint style="info" %}
Due to new fish added to the game,  **v1.11.0+** You need to use a Pufferfish for the effect to work!
{% endhint %}
