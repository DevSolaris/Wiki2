# The hook part of the config allows you to configure which plugins you would like to hook into for votes.
# By default, the plugin will utilize NuVotifier and listen for it's vote events.
# If you would like to use the plugin without NuVotifier, just disable the hook!
# NOTE: Keep in mind that without being hooked into a vote plugin, the plugin will not automatically handle votes.
# You will be required to do everything manually.
# Over time, more plugins may become supported!
hooks:
    # This property represents whether or not to listen to NuVotifier for incoming votes.
    # If the backend is set to true, it assumes that the NuVotifier plugin is already enabled on the backend Spigot server,
    # and pluginMessaging does not need to be enabled. If the backend is disabled, pluginMessaging should be enabled to allow
    # NuVotifier to work on the proxy server. Additionally, make sure that the channel specified here matches the one set in
    # your NuVotifier configuration, and that the "method" in your NuVotifier config is set to "pluginMessaging".
