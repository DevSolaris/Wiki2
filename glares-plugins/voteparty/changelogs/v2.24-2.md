# v2.28

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed a bug preventing users from using the /vp setcounter command to reset the vote count back to 0
* Fixed a bug where you had to enable offline voting for parties in order to allow offline vote claiming. These now process separately so you can prevent votes from counting towards party if the user is offline and still allow them to claim votes if that setting is enabled
