# v2.18

**Bug Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue where placeholders weren't being calculated correctly for the time after the 2.17 update. Please let me know if you still experience issues. \(We are all in agreement to blame Blitz if it's still broken since he's the dedicated tester and confirmed it working\)
