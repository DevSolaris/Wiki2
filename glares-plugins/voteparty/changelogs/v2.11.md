# v2.11

**Features**

* Implemented a brand spanking new Leaderboard system! This allows you to display votes for daily, weekly, monthly, and alltime \(365 days for now\). 
* Leaderboards can be utilized via placeholders! After asking the opinion of some people, they said it was best to not implement a GUI myself for this. So, for now, you can use a plugin like DeluxeMenus or whatnot to display this!
* PLEASE REFER TO THE WIKI FOR THE NEW LEADERBOARD PLACEHOLDERS \([https://wiki.helpch.at/glares-plugins/voteparty](https://wiki.helpch.at/glares-plugins/voteparty)\)

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed the plugin always thinking the version was out of date

**API**

* Implemented PrePartyEvent
* Implemented PartyStartEvent
* Implemented PartyEndEvent

**Note**

* Cancelling the PrePartyEvent OR the PartyStartEvent will cancel parties that are ran on all players. This will not affect parties given via /vp giveparty 
* Leaderboard data is cached and updated every 2 minutes. This might be configurable in a future update.

**Changes** Updated PlaceholderAPI dependencies to ensure everything works

**Closing Notes** Please direct all complaints about bugs to @BrettPlayMC\#0292 If you have any suggestions such as commands and whatnot for Leaderboards, let me know!
