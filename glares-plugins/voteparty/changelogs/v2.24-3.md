# v2.27

**Features**&#x20;

* Implemented support for Minecraft 1.17.1
* Implemented a config option to set the interval on how often (in seconds) that player data is being saved
* Implemented a config option to tell the plugin to save a user's data on vote. This isn't really that big of a deal but some people have requested it in order to sync data faster than the normal interval that you configure.
