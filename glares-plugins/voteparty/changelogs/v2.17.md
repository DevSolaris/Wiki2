# v2.17

**Features** 

* Implemented the ability to set MULTIPLE COMMANDS per chance in the random rewards section for parties and votes. \(PLEASE MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR CONFIG JUST TO BE SAFE\)

**Implemented the ability to give extra rewards based on the website the player voted on! \(I have started a list in the config of known service names for popular voting websites, please let me know if I'm missing any. \(Note: This will only work for players who vote while online\)** 

* Implemented the ability to give extra rewards to players if it's their first time voting!

**Bug Fixes** 

* PLEASE READ
* It was brought to my attention that the way the dates for the Leaderboard were implemented incorrectly. This update makes a big change for this. The way it currently has worked is it would get the past 24 hours / day / month from THE CURRENT TIME OF REQUEST. This new update will properly calculate the time different at the beginning of the day, week, and month.

**API** 

* To make this update possible, the VoteReceivedEvent has been updated to pass in the vote from NuVotifier. You can see the updated event on the wiki.
