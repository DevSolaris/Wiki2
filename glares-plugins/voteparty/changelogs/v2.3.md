# v2.3

**Features**

* Implemented a per-permission reward system. You can now give users extra rewards for voting if they have permission nodes that you specify

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed an issue where the claim command would give party rewards instead of vote rewards
* Hopefully fixed issues with the /vp claim permission
