# v2.25

**Features**&#x20;

* Ensure support on Java 16 (will continue to watch this after Minecraft 1.17 is released)
* Implemented a config option to send rewards to vote claim if the inventory is full. (Apparently some server owners just want to drop the reward if their inventory is full)

**Changes**

* Added an extra check for handling votes. There is a small chance that the communication between the vote website and NuVotifier messes up and it doesn't actually send a name of a player voting. This caused an error to occur in VoteParty. In this update, is the username passed in the vote is null or empty, it will simply fast return and leave a warning in console.
