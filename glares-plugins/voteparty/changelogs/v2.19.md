# v2.19

**Features** 

* Added support for 1.16.2

**Bug Fixes** 

* Fixed names not updating in placeholders after a user has changed their username. This is a bug that has to fix itself over time as players log back in for the first time after this update.

**Changes** 

* If a player's inventory is full when they vote, their rewards will be transformed into a usable /vp claim to be used when their inventory is not full
* When using /vp claim, if a player's inventory is full, it will throw an error saying that their inventory is full and they need to clear some space first
