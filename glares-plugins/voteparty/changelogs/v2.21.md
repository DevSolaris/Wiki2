# v2.21

**Features** 

* This update introduces optional bigadier support for commands \(disabled by default\). To my knowledge this just provides many colors, and it's been requested, so, I made it an option.

**Bug Fixes** 

* Fixed an issue where random party rewards and the permission-based party rewards were still being given despite being in a world that was specified to not give party rewards in.
