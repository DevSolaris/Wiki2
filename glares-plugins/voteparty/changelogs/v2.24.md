# v2.24

**Features** 

* Implemented a brand new cumulative voting system! You can now reward players for voting a specific amount of times in the past day, week, month, year, and total! \(Please keep in mind this feature is designed for players voting while online\).
* Thanks to BlitzOffline for adding an official "annually" tag to the leaderboard. You can now do leaderboard checks by year instead of just all time

**Bug Fixes** 

* Thanks to BlitzOffline for fixing a bug with the all time leaderboard date calculations. This now will properly grab the correct timeframe.
