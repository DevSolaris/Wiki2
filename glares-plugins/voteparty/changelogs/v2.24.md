# v2.30

**Features**

* VoteParty Modes
* This update will include a new feature to allow you to modify how partys work. The are now 3 different modes.
* ```
  1) "everyone" - everyone can join the party whether they voted or not
  ```
* ```
  2) "daily" - everyone who voted in the past 24 hours can join the party
  ```
* ```
  3) "party" - everyone who voted in this specific party can join the party
  ```
* The config is defaulted to everyone, as that has been the normal logic of the plugin since we've gotten to this update.
* Players that did not meet the requirements will be sent a message (configurable in the lang file)
* Added a placeholder to get all of the votes of all time on the server (%voteparty\_votes\_total%)
* Added support for 1.18

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed an issue with disabled worlds not listening properly for crates

**Changes**

* Allow doubles to be used for percent changes in the config
