# v2.12

**Features**

* New placement placeholders! You can now display via palceholders a users placement on the leaderboard given the different types. Please refer to \([https://wiki.helpch.at/glares-plugins/voteparty](https://wiki.helpch.at/glares-plugins/voteparty)\) for updated placeholders
* New vote placeholders! You can now display via placeholders the amount of votes a player has given the different types. Again, please refer to the wiki linked above for the updated placeholders.

**Changes**

* I've redesigned some of the backend of the Leaderboards. Currently it would add all players that ever were on your server to the cache, and I've changed it to only filter the users who vote, so that way it doesn't spend extra resources doing calculations
* Created a null option retrieving users from leaderboards to easier handle placeholders
