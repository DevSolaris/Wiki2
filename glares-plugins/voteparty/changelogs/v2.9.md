# v2.9

**Features**

* Implemented an option to make it so that instead of directly giving the rewards from a party when it's thrown, give a crate.
* Fixed not giving permission party rewards to player when a voteparty was given to a player via command
* Fixed not giving permission party rewards when using it via a crate

**Bug Fixes**

* This fixes an issue where if you gave a crate as a party reward, it would turn into an endless loop.
